## Description
 A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, entertainment, or as an act of compassion such as taking in and protecting a hungry stray cat, rather than as a working animal, livestock, or laboratory animal

# Five key features of the project
_Dependent on Humans to Live
A pet needs to be given food, water, and shelter by its owner. Being domesticated means the animal depends on its owner for all of its care.

Lives in a Home
A pet lives in a home. Some pets such as parakeets and hamsters live in cages. Alternatively, dogs and cats wander freely around a home and may have their own bed to sleep in.

Needs a Veterinarian’s Care
Pets need care from a veterinarian. The type of healthcare a pet needs depends on what type of pet it is. An iguana and a beagle need completely different types of vet care!.

Pets are Different from a Therapy Animal
A therapy animal receives specific training in order to provide support and care to its owner. As an example, some therapy dogs are trained to recognize the signs of a seizure in their owner. The dog responds by trying to get the person to a safe place. Alternatively, a pet is there strictly as a companion.

Cannot Survive in the Wild
One of the main features separating pets from other animals is a pet can’t survive.
